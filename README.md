# SugamKrishi
## A platform that facilitates the formation of farmer communities and equips them with the necessary resources

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Absence of an appropriate platform for farmers to connect and the shortage of valuable information that could enhance their productivity.

#What Problems we aim to solve using our project
1. Lack of farming oriented platform.
2. Lack of technology to access relevant information

#HOW WE AIM TO SOLVE THIS.
1. Some farmers are so isolated in their own routines that they are unaware of developments in nearby communities. Our website aims to provide them with exposure to innovative farming methods and thereby improve their productivity.
2. This platform will be a self-help support systems that helps them help each other.
3. Facilitating interaction among farmers would also enable them to share resources with one another.
4. Our website will also alert farmers to the approaching weather conditions in their region, allowing them to take appropriate measures.
5. Our website also features an AI chatbot that takes input from user both in hindi as well as english and responds accordingly in the respective language

#FEATURES UNIQUE TO OUR WEBSITE:-
1. After conducting a research, we found that there was a lack of websites that connect farmers and facilitate peer-to-peer interactions. That's why we developed our website solution that provides farmers with all the resources they need for their farming activities.
2. Many farmers lack knowledge of modern technologies like weather forecasting, making it difficult for them to plan ahead for their crops. For example, if a dry spell is forecasted, they may need to arrange for irrigation from a water motor supplier. To address this issue, we will implement a weather API that provides them with localized weather information, which will be gathered during the registration process.


#Techs Used:-
Ejs:-
By utilizing the Ejs engine, we were able to present the file to the user in their window through the controller. This was accomplished by retrieving data from the database and incorporating it into the views, all while adhering to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
Passport.Js:-
We utilized this package to grant authorization and authentication to the user, allowing them to perform any action with the help of the Passport local strategy.
Scss:-
In our frontend design, we harnessed the power of SCSS and its impressive syntax to enhance our coding efficiency.
APIs:- 
For data retrieval, we made use of APIs to fetch JSON data from a hosted open-source API by sending API requests
Express :-
To host our application, we employed an Express app, which listened on a specific port.
MongoDB:-
For data storage, we opted for MongoDB in a NoSQL format.
Mongoose:-
To access and manage the data stored in MongoDB, we leveraged the Mongoose framework.
Noty:-
To keep users informed about various actions, we incorporated Noty for sending notifications.
